# HackBright Academy Labs

### 001 Mars Adventure:

- alerts, prompts, consol logs.

This exercise will walk you through building an interactive text adventure game about traveling to
the planet, Mars. You’ll practice capturing user input, producing dynamic output, using
conditional statements and comparison operators, and converting data types.

### 002 Bashcrowl

- bash commands

is a game that you can play to practice using a UNIX shell and to learn some new and useful shell commands. Adapted from https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl under the GNU GPLv3 License.

### 003 Arrays Lab

- solve array problems and push to GitHub.

### 004 Calculator Lab

This project is a building a simple calculator. The calculator will receive a string representing a mathematical expression (e.g. “2 + 3”) and return the answer (e.g. 5).
**index.html** is the file to run the calculator.
**calculator.js** is the file with code.
**Operations:** add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, mod(remainder), sqrt, factorial.

- Step 1: Writing Functions for Operations
- Step 2: Tokenizing a String
- Step 3: Converting to Numbers
- Step 4: Square Roots
- Step 5: Too Many / Too Few Inputs
- Step 6: Factorial

### 005 Objects Lab

- Solve problems in the objects.js file

### 006 Problem Solving Lab

- Lucky Numbers

Given a number, n, return an array containing n unique random numbers between 1-10, inclusive.
That is, do not repeat any numbers in the returned list.
You can trust that this function will never be called with n < 0 or n > 10.

- Is Palindrome

Return true if this word is a palindrome. false if it is not.
A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backwards and forwards.
Case sensitive.

- Callback And Higher Order

Practice using of callback functions

- Array Methods with Arrow Function Expression

Inline arrow functions for callbacks. Methods **map(), forEach(), reduce(), filter(), sort()**.

### 007 Higher Order Methods

Solve problems, practice arrow function expression.

### 008 Animal Shelter Lab

In this project, we’ll be using classes to organize data about animals in an animal shelter.

### 009 HTML & CSS 1

In this lab exercise, you will be creating your own page using HTML & CSS.
