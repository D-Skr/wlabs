/*
    The data below has been collected over the last week at an apple orchard. 
    You will be using your coding skills to gain insights into its daily 
    operations.

    Below are three arrays each containing 7 numbers. You will use them and the 
    price variables to complete the problems in this file.

    The indexes of the arrays correspond with a day of the week.
    The first array is named fujiAcres. Notice that the first item in this array 
    is 2, meaning that 2 acres of Fuji apples were picked on Monday of this week.
*/

const fujiAcres = [2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1]
const galaAcres = [5, 2, 4, 3, 6, 2, 4]
const pinkAcres = [1, 5, 4, 2, 1, 5, 4]


// PROBLEM 1

/*
    Using a for loop, calculate the total number of acres picked for the entire 
    week.

    Save the number to a variable called `totalAcres`.
    Log `totalAcres` to the console.
*/

// CODE HERE

//the total number of acres picked for the entire week.
let totalAcres = 0;
//iterate through the 7 days.
for (let i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
    //add sum of acres for each day 
    totalAcres += fujiAcres[i] + galaAcres[i] + pinkAcres[i];
}

console.log(totalAcres + " - the total number of acres picked for the entire week");

// PROBLEM 2

/*
    Using `totalAcres`, calculate the average number of acres picked per day. 

    (Remember that the average is the total divided by the number of days)

    Save the answer to a variable called 
    `averageDailyAcres`, and log `averageDailyAcres` to the console.
*/

// CODE HERE

//the average number of acres picked per day: the total divided by the number of days

// PROBLEM 3

/*
    We have provided 2 variables below. 
    
    The `acresLeft` variable is the number of acres that still have apples left. 
    
    The `days` variable represents how many more days of work are left. It's 
    initialized at 0 because we're going to be using it as a counter.
    
    Write a while loop that will continue to run while `acresLeft` is above 0. 
    
    On each iteration of the loop:
    - add 1 to the `days` variable
    - subtract your daily average from the number of acres left

    Outside the loop, log `days` to the console.

    Note: This is not the most efficient way to calculate this number. You might
    think about other ways you could do it more mathematically.

// PROBLEM 4

/*
    Your next task is to create 3 arrays that list the daily amount of apples 
    picked, in tons, for each variety. 
    
    Each acre yields 6.5 tons of apples.

    don't modify the original arrays on lines 36 - 38.
